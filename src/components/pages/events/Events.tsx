              <h3>ANGLO TALKS</h3>
              <p>
                This Saturday our first Talking Club took place in English, where we discussed issues of adaptation to a
                new country and mental health in an unfamiliar environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                During the meeting, we got to know each other and shared stories of adaptation, creating an atmosphere
                of open communication.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the participants told how he found his own methods of overcoming difficulties, and another
                shared the story of positive changes in his life after moving.
                <br />
                <br />
                Through dialogue and exchange of experience, we enriched our knowledge about overcoming difficulties in
                a new society and improved our communication skills in Englishü§ç.
